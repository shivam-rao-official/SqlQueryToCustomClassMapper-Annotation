# SqlQueryToCustomClassMapper-Annotation

SqlQueryToCustomClassMapper-Annotation is a Java library that provides a custom annotation `@SqlQueryToCustomClassMapper` for mapping SQL query results to custom Java classes or interfaces.

## Overview

This library simplifies the process of mapping SQL query results directly to Java objects using annotations. It automates the generation of mapping code, reducing boilerplate and improving code maintainability.

## Features

- **Custom Annotation**: Define mappings using `@SqlQueryToCustomClassMapper` to specify SQL queries and target Java classes/interfaces.
- **Automatic Code Generation**: Generates mapping code based on annotated interfaces.
- **Flexibility**: Supports any SQL query and custom Java class/interface for mapping.

## How to Use

### Installation

Add the library to your Maven project by including the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>sql-query-to-custom-class-mapper-annotation</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version> <!-- Replace with the actual version -->
</dependency>
```

### Usage Example

1. **Define an annotated interface**:

   ```java
   import java.sql.ResultSet;

   @SqlQueryToCustomClassMapper(sqlQuery = "SELECT id, name FROM users", targetClass = User.class)
   public interface UserMapper {
       User mapResultSet(ResultSet resultSet);
   }
   ```

   - Replace `User` with your custom Java class or interface.
   - `sqlQuery` specifies the SQL query to execute.
   - `targetClass` specifies the target class for mapping results.

2. **Implement the target class** (`User`):

   ```java
   public class User {
       private int id;
       private String name;

       // Constructor, getters, and setters
   }
   ```

3. **Use the generated mapper**:

   ```java
   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           // Execute SQL query and obtain ResultSet
           ResultSet resultSet = executeQuery("SELECT id, name FROM users");

           // Get the mapper instance
           UserMapper mapper = MapperFactory.getMapper(UserMapper.class);

           // Map ResultSet to User object
           User user = mapper.mapResultSet(resultSet);

           // Use mapped User object
           System.out.println("Mapped User: " + user);
       }
   }
   ```
